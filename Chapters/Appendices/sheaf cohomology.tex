\section{Sheaf cohomology on sites}
    We develop, throughout this section, the theory of sheaf cohomology (in the classical sense\footnote{I.e. we restrict our attention to cohomologies of abelian and (quasi-)coherent sheaves and exclude cohomology theories such as constructible cohomology from our discussions.}) on a general site. 

    \subsection{Abelian sheaf cohomology}
        \subsubsection{Abelian sheaf cohomologies as right-derived functors}
            \begin{convention}
                If $A$ is a (commutative) ring object within some topos, then we shall denote the corresponding \textit{abelian} category of \textit{underived} $A$-modules by $A\mod$, whereas $A\mod$ shall be used for denoting the derived category of $A$-modules with its canonical $t$-structure $(A\mod^{\leq 0}, A\mod^{\geq 0})$. Also, our indexing will always be cohomological! 
            \end{convention}
            \begin{remark}
                Recall that if $(\C, J)$ is a site then the category $\Shv_{\Z}(\C, J)^{\heart}$, whose objects are sheaves of abelian groups on $(\C, J)$, will be an abelian category with enough injectives. As such, any object $\calF \in \Ob(\Shv_{\Z}(\C, J)^{\heart})$ admits an injective resolution $\calF \to \calF^{\bullet}$ wherein $\calF^{\bullet}[0] \cong \calF$ and $\calF^{\bullet}[d]$ is injective for all $d \geq 1$. This phenomenon leads us to the following definition of ($J$-)sheaf cohomology on the site $(\C, J)$.
            \end{remark}
            \begin{convention}
                If $A$ is a sheaf of rings (or even a sheaf of monoids) on a site $(\C, J)$ then we shall write $\Shv_A(\C, J)$ for the category of (sheaves of) $A$-modules on $(\C, J)$. The only exception to this rule is when $A$ is the structure sheaf $\calO_X$ of a ringed site $(X, \calO_X)$: in that case, we shall stick to the traditional notation $\calO_X\mod$ instead of writing $\Shv_{\calO_X}(X)$.
            \end{convention}
            \begin{definition}[Sheaf cohomology on sites] \label{def: sheaf_cohomology_on_sites}
                Let $(\C, J)$ be a site and let $U \in \Ob(\C)$ be an object thereof. To each such object $U$, one may associate a family $\{H^i_{(\C, J)}(U, -)\}_{i \in \Z}$ of \textbf{cohomology functors}:
                    $$H^i_{(\C, J)}(U, -): \Shv_{\Z}(\C_{/U}) \to \Z\mod^{\heart}$$
                    $$\calF^{\bullet} \mapsto H^i_{\Z}(\Gamma(U, \calF^{\bullet}))$$
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark}[Cohomology functors are exact] \label{remark: cohomology_functors_are_exact}
                Per some basic homological algebra, any family of cohomology functors $\{H^i_{(\C, J)}(U, -)\}_{i \in \Z}$ associated to an object $U$ of a site $(\C, J)$ as in definition \ref{def: sheaf_cohomology_on_sites} determines a functor:
                    $$H^*_{(\C, J)}(U, -): \Shv_{\Z}(\C, J) \to \Z\mod$$
                    $$\calF^{\bullet} \mapsto H^*_{\Z}(\Gamma(U, \calF^{\bullet}))$$
                wherein $H^*(\Gamma(U, \calF^{\bullet}))$ is to be understood as the long exact sequence of cohomology groups associated to the long exact sequence of abelian groups $\Gamma(U, \calF^{\bullet})$ (recall that $H^*_{\Z}(-) \cong \Ext^*_{\Z}(\Z, -)$ and at the same time, that $\Z$ is a projective object of $\Z\mod^{\heart}$). As such, any cohomology functor $H^*_{(\C, J)}(U, -)$ can be interpreted as the composition:
                    $$H^*_{\Z} \circ \R\Gamma: \Shv_{\Z}(\C_{/U}) \to \Z\mod$$
                Since the functors $\R\Gamma$ and $H^*_{\Z}$ are both exact \textit{a priori}, so is the cohomology functor $H^*_{(\C, J)}(U, -)$. 
                
                Furthermore, since both $\R\Gamma$ and $H^*_{\Z}$ are right-derived functors, the universal property of derived functors (or rather, that of Kan extensions) guarantees that for any object $U \in \Ob(\C)$, the corresponding cohomology functor $H^*_{(\C, J)}(U, -)$ also arises as the right-derived functor of some (left-)exact functor $\Shv_{\Z}(\C, J)^{\heart} \to \Z\mod^{\heart}$. In particular, this means that the cohomology functor $H^*_{(\C, J)}(U, -)$ is a homological universal $\delta$-functor (in the sense of Grothendieck).
            \end{remark}
            \begin{remark}[Resolution-independence of cohomology functors] \label{remark: resolution_independence_of_cohomology_functors}
                Fix a module $M$ over some commutative ring $R$ and recall that $\Ext^i_R(M, N^{\bullet})$ (for all $i \in \Z$) is independent of the choice of injective\footnote{Recall also that $R\mod^{\heart}$ has enough injectives.} resolution $N^{\bullet}$ for any test $R$-module $N$. By combining this with the analysis from remark \ref{remark: cohomology_functors_are_exact}, one sees that indeed, the cohomology groups $H^i_{(\C, J)}(U, \calF)$ as in definition \ref{def: sheaf_cohomology_on_sites} are independent of the choice of injective resolution $\calF^{\bullet}$; as such, the cohomology functors $H^*_{(\C, J)}(U, \calF)$ are well-defined as functors on the derived category $\Shv_{\Z}(\C_{/U})$.
            \end{remark}
        
        \subsubsection{Higher direct image functors}
            \begin{definition}[Higher direct images] \label{def: higher_direct_images}
                Suppose that $\C$ and $\D$ are sites and that:
                    $$(f^* \ladjoint f_*): \Sh(\C) \to \Sh(\D)$$
                is a morphism of the corresponding sheaf topoi. Then, we define the corresponding \textbf{higher direct image functor} as follows:
                    $$\R f_*: \Shv_{\Z}(\C) \to \Shv_{\Z}(\D)$$
                    $$\calF^{\bullet} \mapsto H^*_{\Shv_{\Z}(\D)}(f_* \calF^{\bullet})$$
            \end{definition}
